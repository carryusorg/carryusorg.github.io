      Let's face it, independent fundraising is a lot of hard work. Many overtaxed 
      charities hope that enthusiastic and big hearted volunteers would
      be happy to shoulder this burden. While most of us are enthusiastic and big 
      hearted, financial support can make the difference between a one time runner and 
      a sustained campaigner. This is how Carry.Us.Org can help.

      - athletes can state their campaign expenses alongside the funding goals for every new campaign
      - these campaign expenses can be reimbursed by tips given transparently during the donation process
      - high value campaigns, and the athletes that run them, are rewarded with incentives
      - these incentives may be virtual badges and/or real valuable gifts
      - incentive gifts are solicited from sponsoring nonprofit and for-profit corporations

      Athletic fundraisers are unique to all others, in that there is a measurable challenge
      that one endeavors to overcome in order to inspire others to give. With the right tools
      and creativity, an athlete can leverage her challenging experiences to inspire 
      thousands of others in support of her cause. With our suite of communication and 
      outreach tools, Carry.Us.Org brings these challenges to life.

      - campaign microsites to promote your cause and your fundraising progress
      - a mobile app to track your athletic progress and update your campaign story
      - receive donations on your phone or on your microsite
      - collect donor information on your phone or on your microsite
      - send emails and post social media updates from the field
      - ect...

      Charitable organizations are typically overworked and under staffed. 
      It's no wonder that they don't have the time or resources to cater to
      the varying needs of independent fundraisers. That's where Cary.Us.Org 
      fits in. We will negotiate on the athletes behalf, to secure a relationship
      that benefits all parties. Bellow are some examples of the discussions we are having: 
    
      - a single point of contact within the charity organization to smooth communications
      - the use of prominent charity branding to legitimatize an athlete's campaign 
      - the ability to fundraise for individual projects within the charity
      - solicitation of incentive gifts for high value campaigns
      - ectâ€¦
