      Let's face it, fundraising is time consuming and resource intensive work. 
      It's common for charities to assume that this burden will be happily shouldered by 
      enthusiastic and big hearted supporters. While most of us are enthusiastic and big 
      hearted, it would still be nice to see independent fundraisers reward for their efforts. 
      Here's how we see it:

      - athletes can state their own reimburasble campaign expenses
      - campaign expenses can be reimbursed by tips given alongside the charitable donations
      - high value campaigns, and the athletes that run them, are awarded with incentives
      - these incentives may be virtual badges and/or real valuable gifts
      - incentive gifts are solicited from sponsoring nonprofit and for-profit corporations

      Athletic fundraisers are unique to all others in that there is a measurable challenge
      that one endeavors to overcome in order to inspire others to give. With the right tools
      and creativity an athlete can leverage their experience of this challenge to inspire 
      thousands of others in support of her cause. With our suite of communication and 
      outreach tools, Carry.Us.Org brings these challenges to life.

      Charitable organizations are typically over worked and under staffed. 
      It's no wonder that they don't have the time or resources to cater to
      the varying needs of independent fundraisers. That's where Cary.Us.Org 
      fits in. We will negotiate on the athletes behalf, to secure a relationship
      that benefits all parties. Bellow are some examples of the discussions we are having: 
    
      - a single point of contact within the charity organization to smooth communications
      - the use of prominent charity branding to legitimatize an athlete's campaign 
      - the ability to fundraise for individual projects within the charity
      - solicitation of incentive gifts for high value campaigns
      - ectâ€¦

    Carry.Us.Org is funded only by tips. **We will never charge a service fee to the athletes, 
    or take a cut from the donations raised**{:.text-warning}. For each active campaign, 
    we deduct a single flat fee from the campaign reimbursement tips. This fee is calculated 
    as a percentage of the campaign's stated funding goal. If not enough tips are 
    collected to cover the whole fee, the remainder will be waived.
