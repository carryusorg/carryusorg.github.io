    title: Charity Relationship Management 
    description: |
      Charitable organizations are typically over worked and under staffed. 
      It's no wonder that they don't have the time or resources to cater to
      the varying needs of independent fundraisers. That's where Cary.Us.Org 
      fits in. We will negotiate on the athletes behalf, to secure a relationship
      that benefits all parties. Bellow are some examples of the discussions we are having: 
    
      - a single point of contact within the charity organization to smooth communications
      - the use of prominent charity branding to legitimatize an athlete's campaign 
      - the ability to fundraise for individual projects within the charity
      - solicitation of gifts for the performance incentives program
      - ectâ€¦

      Athletic fundraisers are unique to all others in that there is a measurable challenge
      that one endeavors to overcome in order to inspire others to give. With the right tools
      and creativity an athlete can leverage their experience of this challenge to inspire 
      thousands of others in support of her cause. With our suite of communication and 
      outreach tools, Carry.Us.Org brings these challenges to life.

    title: Campaign Reimbursement & Incentives
    description: |
      Let's face it, fundraising is time consuming and resource intensive work. 
      It's common for charities to assume that this burden will be happily shouldered by 
      enthusiastic and big hearted supporters. While most of us are enthusiastic and big 
      hearted, it would still be nice to see independent fundraisers reward for their efforts. 
      Here's how we see it:

      - a campaign funding mechanism based on tips offered on top of every donation
      - simple and transparent donation and tip processing and receipting 
      - an integrated display showing both fundraising goals and campaign expenses being met
      - an integrated incentives program to reward high value campaigns and the athletes that run them
      - the incentives awarded are virtual badges as well as tangible and valuable gifts
      - incentive gifts are solicited from sponsoring nonprofit and for-profit corporations alike



pricing:
  description: |
    Carry.Us.Org will never charge a service fee to the athletes, or take a cut from the donations raised. We charge only for each active campaign. This campaign fee is deducted from the tips that athletes collect to fund their campaigns, and will never be charged directly to an athlete  (even if no tips are collected).
